# LANIAKEA
LANIAKEA is an reactive musical animation that responds to MIDI input. 

Written in Processing by Daniel Dole-Muinos & Christopher Ward.

Demonstrated at Art in Engineering 2019 at the Harn Museum in Gainesville, Florida.

A demo can be seen here: https://youtu.be/K0TuwLIpgKE 

The track demonstrated in the demo was composed on-the-fly by Daniel Dole-Muinos using a custom Live Set (in Ableton) built such that anyone can string together a song using pre-composed, quantized loops, and using a Ableton Push/MidiFighter Twister combo for control.
